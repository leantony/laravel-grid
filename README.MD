# Laravel grid (laravel 5.6+)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leantony/laravel-grid.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/leantony/laravel-grid)

This package allows rendering of data via a tabular format (grid). The grid uses bootstrap classes to style the `table` elements. Icons used are from `font-awesome`, and most of the functionality is insipred by the yii2's framework's gridview widget. 

# Features
+ Grid generation via a laravel command.
+ Full export functionality - (to pdf, csv, and excel. Relies on the `maatwebsite/excel` package)
+ Bootstrap modal support
+ Customizable column filters (supports text, date, date-range, dropdowns)
+ Adding of dynamic column names (that do not exist on the actual eloquent models)
+ Raw HTML support for the column data
+ Customizable global search
+ Attribute sorting
+ Dynamic addition, removal and disabling of buttons
+ Dynamic manipulation of row and column HTML classes
+ pjax support
+ Pagination


## Requirements
The grid supports [pjax](https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax) out of the box. For pjax support on laravel, try - [spatie/laravel-pjax](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-pjax), or create the middleware on your own using [jeffrey way's middleware.](https://gist.github.com/JeffreyWay/8526696b6f29201c4e33)

+ Bootstrap 3 (for the styling)
+ Font awesome (for icons)
+ Jquery (required by bootstrap and the package's javascript)
+ Jquery pjax (quickly view data without having to reload the page)
+ [Block UI](https://github.com/malsup/blockui) (optional - to 'block' the UI when doing an AJAX request that might presumably take a while).
+ [Date picker](https://github.com/dangrossman/bootstrap-daterangepicker.git) (optional - for the single date & date range filters)


## Installation
The package is available on packagist. Just run;
```php
composer install leantony/laravel-grid
```
You can then publish the resources (views) and assets (css & js), incase you need to customize them. The css and js will be copied to `public/vendor/leantony/grid`

```php
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Leantony\Grid\Providers\ServiceProvider"
```
> You can publish the assets and views separately by passing the `--tag` argument to the command. For the argument values, try `assets`, `views` or `config` for js|css assets, views and config respectively.

You can also run `php artisan vendor:publish` and select the provider index by the name `Leantony\Grid\Providers\ServiceProvider`

When the package is updated, it is highly likely that you will also need to update the javascript assets. To do that, run this command below after an update;
```php
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Leantony\Grid\Providers\ServiceProvider" --tag=assets --force
```
> You can also place this command in composer so that it is executed automatically on each update run. Like this;
```php
// ... composer config
"post-autoload-dump": [
    "Illuminate\\Foundation\\ComposerScripts::postAutoloadDump",
    "@php artisan package:discover",
    "@php artisan vendor:publish --provider=\"Leantony\\Grid\\Providers\\ServiceProvider\" --tag=assets --force"
]
```


## Usage
A laravel command is available to make it easy to create grids. 
Once installed, just run the command:
```php
php artisan make:grid --model="{modelClass}"
```
Just make sure you replace `{modelClass}` with your actual `eloquent` model class. E.g
```php
php artisan make:grid --model="App\User"
```
Once this is run, a grid will be generated. Default namespace for grid generation is `App\Grids`.

Once the generation of the grid is done, you can add add it in your controller like this. E.g a `user` model grid:

```php
class UsersController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Display a listing of the resource.
     *
     * @param UsersGridInterface $usersGrid
     * @param Request $request
     * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response
     */
    public function index(UsersGridInterface $usersGrid, Request $request)
    {
        // the 'query' argument needs to be an instance of the eloquent query builder
        // you can load relationships at this point
        return $usersGrid
                    ->create(['query' => User::query(), 'request' => $request])
                    ->renderOn('welcome'); // render the grid on the welcome view
    }
}
```
> If you inject the interface on the controller, just make sure that you add a binding to the service provider. Like this;
```php
     /**
     * Register any application services.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function register()
    {
        $this->app->bind(UsersGridInterface::class, UsersGrid::class);
    }
```


Otherwise, you can also instantiate the grid class like any other class then inject any constructor dependencies you might need.
```php
    /**
     * Display a listing of the resource.
     *
     * @param Request $request
     * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response
     */
    public function index(Request $request)
    {
        $user = $request->user();
        return (new UsersGrid(['user' => $user)) // you can then use it as $user within the class. It's set implicitly using the __set() call
                    ->create(['query' => User::query(), 'request' => $request])
                    ->renderOn('welcome');
    }
```
> Adding `$user` above as part of the key value pair array on the create method would achieve the same results as above.


If you need to pass extra data to the view specified, you just need to pass the data as arguments, just as you do normally on any other laravel controller;
```php
    /**
     * Display a listing of the resource.
     *
     * @param Request $request
     * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response
     */
    public function index(Request $request)
    {
        $data = 'hello world';
        
        return (new UsersGrid())
                    ->create(['query' => User::query(), 'request' => $request])
                    ->renderOn('welcome', compact('data'));
    }
```


For eloquent relationships, its basically the same approach. Just ensure that you pass in an instance of the query builder. Like this;
```php
class UsersController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Display a listing of the resource.
     *
     * @param UsersGridInterface $usersGrid
     * @param Request $request
     * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response
     */
    public function index(UsersGridInterface $usersGrid, Request $request)
    {
        // load relationships
        $query = User::with(['posts', 'activities'])
        return $usersGrid
                    ->create(['query' => $query, 'request' => $request])
                    ->renderOn('welcome');
    }
}
```

Then display the grid on your view like this;
```php
{!! $grid !!}
```

You should see something like this (see the image below). Feel free to check out the [sample app](http://laravel-grid.herokuapp.com). Also for reference, its source code is [here](https://github.com/leantony/laravel-grid-app)

To enable javascript utilities such as Pjax, ensure that you have their dependencies included on your page/layout. Once you have done that, ensure that you have a `@push('grid_js')` section on your view/layout, just after the required javascript dependencies. This is the point where the grid's javscript will be injected. An example is as shown below;
```php

    <!-- dependencies e.g jquery, pjax, bootstrap js come here -->
    
    <!-- load the grid's javascipt -->
    <script src="{{ asset('vendor/leantony/grid/js/grid.js') }}"></script>
    <script>
        // setup ajax. This is required, so that the CSRF token is sent during AJAX requests
        $.ajaxSetup({
            headers: {
                'X-CSRF-TOKEN': $('meta[name="csrf-token"]').attr('content')
            }
        });
    </script>
    <!-- the initialization javascript for any of the grid(s) you create will be injected here. Having this will ensure that the script is executed after it's dependencies have been loaded. -->
    @stack('grid_js')
```
> Just make sure that the `meta` element with the name `csrf-token` is available on your layout/blade view. E.g
```html
<meta name="csrf-token" content="{{ csrf_token() }}">
```

To customize the grid, check out [the customization section](https://github.com/leantony/laravel-grid/wiki/Customization). Following the instructions above should get you on the right track. However, if you run into any issues, please be sure to [raise it](https://github.com/leantony/laravel-grid/issues/new).

# TODO's
+ Add unit tests (in progress. The `passing` badge was triggered by running a dummy unit test actually. Real tests will soon be added).
+ Completion of documentation (in progress).
+ Add more customization options to published config file. Stuff like pagination, filters, buttons, etc
+ Toggle between sorting in ascending and descending order.
+ Add ability to culminate grid rows. E.g displaying a total of some sort.
+ Add ability to have a checkbox that can be used to select multiple items, after which an action can be done. E.g deleting mutiple items.
